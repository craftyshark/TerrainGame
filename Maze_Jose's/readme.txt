HELLO! 
My name is Jose Fernando Jimenez Chavez and I am the sole author of this project. 
I'll be honest and tell you off the bat what this project does not have 
Doesn't load map from txt file
doesn't generate terrain from quadtrees 
doesn't have shortest path implemented 
does not contain seperate class for map


what DOES it have? 
well, It complies, it has a readme (this), 
clicking the CBP file should load all files automatically. 
It is very simple to use and I will explain that futher below. 
It's main is well commented. 
it runs and is possible to test 
it uses the player class for the 4 characters 
it does display a maze based on a matrix
it does generate terrain randomly. 
it does have user control. Left click to select character, right click to select destination. 
This is my report. 
you can select from different maps by selecting a different seed 
Am very able to explain the project
